# Hei_Ideas

Hei_Ideas(a tentative name for now) aims to build the idea and knowledge network. The goal for doing this is to help the researchers to do literature review. The expected outcome of this tool is a complete report (in some formats) on a particular area, in which the researcher interests. I am thinking of doing this because I have a difficult time to search for a topic, when I firstly step on that area. With the help of this tool, I can quickly have the overview of this area, which saves me a lot of time and effort. It is also useful, when we want to learn the existing knowledge to gain new insights (mining on ideas). 

I would like to start the project with my current research area which is security. First, I will build the network based on the knowledge in papers and journals. Then, I can add more information such as practical tools, like project information in Github. Finally, I want add everything in, which is impossible. But it is a cool thing, isn't it.
